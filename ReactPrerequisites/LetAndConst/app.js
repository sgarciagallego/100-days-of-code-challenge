// * var variable declaration - declares variables globally
// * const variable declaration - cannot change its value after declaration
// * let variable declaration - similar to let, can change value after declaration, but declarations are local

/*

  ? declare a variable using const by default
  ? if you realise the value of a const declaration has to change, you refactor it into let variable declaration
