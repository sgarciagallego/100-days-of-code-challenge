/*
  ? The core idea of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is to divide programs into smaller pieces & make each piece responsible for managing its own state
  * Interfaces - a boundary which two independent systems meet and act on or communicate with one another
  * Public Properties - properties which are a part of the interface
  * Private Properties - properties which the outside code should not be touching
  ! JavaScript does not have a way to distinguish between private an public properties - therefore, interfaces are not really a thing
  ? Private Property Naming Convention - start the property name with an underscore (_)
  
  * Encapsulation - separating the interface from implementation
