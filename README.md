## Outline

| Day | Overview        | What I have learnt                                                                                                                     |
| --- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | Values          | **Values** are essentially large chunks of bits                                                                                            |
|     | Numbers         | Numbers are numeric values                                                                                                             |
|     |                 | adding ```e``` to a number will add an exponent ( 2.998e8 = 2.998 * 10^8 )                                                             |
|     | Special Numbers | ```Infinity``` & ```-Infinity``` represent positive and negative infinities                                                            |
|     |                 | ```NaN``` means "not a number", is displayed when numeric operations don't create a meaningful result                                  |
|     | Operators       | Operators are symbols such as ```*``` and ```/```                                                                                      |
|     |                 | Putting an operator between values will apply it to those values and create a new value as a result                                    |
|     |                 | When operators appear together without parentheses, the order they are applied is to do with their [precendence](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#table) |
|     |                 | **Unary Operators** are operators which only take *1 value*                                                                            |
|     |                 | **Binary Operators** are operators which take *2 values*                                                                               |
|     |                 | ```typeof``` produces a string value naming the data type you give it. e.g. ```console.log(typeof "x") -> string```                    |
|     | Strings         | **Strings** are used to represent text                                                                                                 |
|     |                 | ```alert(`...`);``` - **template literals** can contain placeholders and can include newlines without escaping                         |
|     |                 | ```".."``` and ```'...'``` are virtually the same thing (single and double quotes)                                                     |
|     |                 | ```\t``` is used in a string when inline whitespace is needed and ```\n``` is used when a newline is needed                            |
|     |                 | Strings can be used with the ```+``` operator to **concatenate** (glue) strings together                                               |
|     |                 | when you write something inside ```${}``` within a template literal, it's result will be converted to a string and included within     |
