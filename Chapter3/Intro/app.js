/*
  * Functions - a set of code that is wrapped to perform a specific task - hence the name: function

  ? It gives a way to structure larger applications, to associate naes with subprograms, to avoid repititions and to isolate subprograms from each other
  ! The most obvious application of functions is defining new vocabulary (in programming these are known as functions)
